AmberAlerting is a minimal web application that provides a RESTful API for managing alerts. Each alert includes a message and a countdown timer (in seconds). Alerts can be created, retrieved, stopped, snoozed, or deleted. The system tracks the status of each alert (active or stopped) and persists all data in a database. The snooze operation delays the alert's countdown by a specified number of seconds. This API is designed to be simple and well-structured so that it can be easily integrated with AI agents that trigger or manage alerts as part of a larger automation workflow.
